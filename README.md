# Simple_Chat_App

This is the final assignment that we had at the ITBootcamp, it is a simple chat app made with Vanilla JS and firebase.
You can change username, switch rooms, and delete your own messages.
1. Go to firstore and create db named Chats
2. Create an index for name, created_at, room and use auto_id
That is it, the app will do the rest
